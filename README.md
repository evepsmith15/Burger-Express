# Burger-Express
Homework 12

Do you like burgers? Do you like eating burgers? Well, Burger express is a fun program that shows you a list of different types of burgers. Some of the burgers are eaten. Some of them have yet to be eaten. A simple click of the button will cosume the burger. Found a burger that wasn't initially listed? There is a place where a new burger can be submitted to be devoured! 

The code is a simple program that lists burgers that have and have not been eaten. The code reads off the burger controller for the express command. When you click on the button, the burger will be moved to eaten. At the end, all the burgers should be on the eaten side. A new burger (or whatever is written) and placed where the uneaten burgers are. Refreshing will cause the commands to disappear.
